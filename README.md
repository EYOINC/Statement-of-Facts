FACT 12. Happyness is your choice, they can take everything else from you, from your life to your freedom, but your happy regardless of how dier your situation is, has to be given away by you.. That choice is only yours.. & you would be a damn fool to allow someone or something to take it from you.. Remember change your situation until you are happy.. Everyone has reasons to get mad, sad, or upset, but your purpose is greater than that. You are made in his image and likeness.. Please be mindful of your possibility if you dont limit it with anger, or hate, things that God did not give us. Hate and Evil are things created by stupid beings that do not follow there virtious soul, or conchens, and will not be saved.
Fact 13. being placed in hell is being frozen in your light being formed conscience but not able to move cuz Frozen burning from the Frozen because cold ice burns and thrown into outer space where you were not here or see anything or even move but stay a conscience and alive as a light being praying that someday you'll burn up into his son so you'll be reincarnated back into a body.. That's your faite if you are evil during his life hopefully virtuouless, just gets you back reincarnated as a human, so you can try again.. ..
If you were once godlike and you were put on Earth and made to be human would you not consider that being put in hell. I'm afraid you are in hell. and my virtue is how you will escape it..
